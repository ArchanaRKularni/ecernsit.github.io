### Technoids Test 1 @ECE Hi-Tech lab
Greetings from *Team Technoids*. We are a passionate group of four, with the aim to spread knowledge on *Machine Learning*, *Deep Learning* and *Computer Vision* to our fellow RNSITians via workshops. 
Similar to Falcon, Technoids is our initiation to concentrate primarily on the *Artificial Intelligence* domain, which is the bleeding edge of technology in the upcoming decades. 
We will be conducting two rounds for the selection process: Written Test and Interview for the shortlisted students. *No prior knowledge on Artificial Intelligence is required for any of the rounds*. Selection will be based on basic C/C++/Python programming questions and algorithmic problem-solving capability.
Eligibility: Students currently in *First, Second or Third Year of RNSIT ECE Dept*. 
Further details can be found in the Google Forms registration link:
