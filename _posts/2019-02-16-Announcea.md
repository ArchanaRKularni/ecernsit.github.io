### Technoids Test 1 @ECE Hi-Tech lab
Greetings from *Team Technoids*. We are a passionate group of four, with the aim to spread knowledge on *Machine Learning*, *Deep Learning* and *Computer Vision* to our fellow RNSITians via workshops. 
Similar to Falcon, Technoids is our initiation to concentrate primarily on the *Artificial Intelligence* domain, which is the bleeding edge of technology in the upcoming decades. 
We will be conducting two rounds for the selection process: Written Test and Interview for the shortlisted students. *No prior knowledge on Artificial Intelligence is required for any of the rounds*. Selection will be based on basic C/C++/Python programming questions and algorithmic problem-solving capability.
Eligibility: Students currently in *First, Second or Third Year of RNSIT ECE Dept*. 
Further details can be found in the Google Forms registration link:

### Technoids
Greetings from Team Technoids,

We are happy to announce that we will be conducting a workshop on Computer Vision and Deep Learning using Python. The workshop will mainly focus on Image Processing (i.e. Handling Images using OpenCV) and Deep Learning. During the course of the workshop, you'll be learning different techniques to handle the image and also learn the basics of Deep Learning. By the end of the workshop, you would have completed 3 projects and also have the knowledge of building your own custom Classifier.

The 3 projects being.
1) Coding Harry Potter's Invisibility Cloak.
2) Classifying Hand Written Digits.
3) Classification of Dogs v/s Cats.

The workshop will be held on 19th, 20th, and 21st of April.
The Fees charged for being a participant is Rs /- 200.
Refreshments will be provided for the participants and they will also be receiving a participation certificate under the banner of IEEE and Technoids.

We have an intake of 60 participants and their seats for the workshop will be confirmed after making the payment. Payment can be done by cash or Paytm or Google Pay.

Department first floor by our volunteers. (Preferable mode of payment is Google Pay or Cash.)

There are as such no pre-requisites for attending the workshop. Only the willingness and the enthusiasm to learn are the required pre-requisites. We will start the workshop from the basics of Python. The workshop is a complete hands-on session. Therefore, the participants are expected to bring their laptops.
